# Fixes Summary
**Date:** 2025-01-11
**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED

---

## Overview

Successfully completed:
1. ✅ Replaced all STT references with ETH
2. ✅ Replaced all Somnia references with Base
3. ✅ Fixed airdrop cancel functionality conditions

---

## Changes Made

### 1. ✅ STT → ETH Replacement

Replaced all occurrences of "STT" with "ETH" across the codebase since the project now uses Base Sepolia (ETH) instead of Somnia Testnet (STT).

**Files Modified:**
- `src/components/DisputeManager.tsx` - 8 instances
- `src/components/BountyCard.tsx` - 2 instances
- `src/components/BountyManager.tsx` - 2 instances
- `src/components/AirdropCard.tsx` - 2 instances
- `src/components/AirdropManager.tsx` - 5 instances
- `src/components/ManageSection.tsx` - 5 instances
- `src/app/bounties/[id]/page.tsx` - 2 instances
- `src/app/airdrops/[id]/page.tsx` - 2 instances

**Examples:**
- `{formatETH(bounty.amount)} STT` → `{formatETH(bounty.amount)} ETH`
- `Amount (STT) *` → `Amount (ETH) *`
- `Minimum: {MIN_VOTING_STAKE} STT` → `Minimum: {MIN_VOTING_STAKE} ETH`

---

### 2. ✅ Somnia → Base Replacement

Updated all references from "Somnia Testnet" to "Base Sepolia" to reflect the correct network.

**Files Modified:**
- `src/app/layout.tsx` - 1 instance

**Change:**
```typescript
// BEFORE
description: "A transparent bounty platform with governance, reputation NFTs, and dispute resolution on Somnia Testnet"

// AFTER
description: "A transparent bounty platform with governance, reputation NFTs, and dispute resolution on Base Sepolia"
```

### 3. ✅ Fixed Airdrop Cancel Functionality

**Problem Identified:**
The airdrop cancel button was showing for ALL airdrops, even when cancellation shouldn't be allowed per the smart contract rules.

**Smart Contract Requirements (from AirdropBounty.sol:281-294):**
```solidity
function cancelAirdrop(uint256 _id) external validAirdrop(_id) nonReentrant {
    Airdrop storage airdrop = airdrops[_id];
    require(msg.sender == airdrop.creator, "Only creator can cancel");
    require(!airdrop.resolved && !airdrop.cancelled, "Cannot cancel");
    require(airdrop.qualifiersCount == 0, "Has approved entries");  // ⚠️ KEY REQUIREMENT

    airdrop.cancelled = true;

    // Refund creator
    (bool success, ) = payable(airdrop.creator).call{value: airdrop.totalAmount}("");
    require(success, "Refund failed");

    emit AirdropCancelled(_id, airdrop.totalAmount);
}
```

**Cancel Requirements:**
1. ✅ Only creator can cancel
2. ✅ Cannot cancel if already resolved or cancelled
3. ❌ **Cannot cancel if any entries have been approved** (qualifiersCount > 0)

**The Fix:**

Updated `src/components/AirdropManager.tsx:1475` to add proper conditions:

```typescript
// BEFORE (showing for ALL airdrops)
<Button
  onClick={() => cancelAirdrop(airdrop.id)}
  disabled={isCancelling}
  variant="outline"
  size="sm"
>
  <X className="w-3 h-3 mr-1" />
  {isCancelling ? "Cancelling..." : "Cancel"}
</Button>

// AFTER (only showing when cancellation is allowed)
{!airdrop.resolved && !airdrop.cancelled && airdrop.qualifiersCount === 0 && (
  <Button
    onClick={() => cancelAirdrop(airdrop.id)}
    disabled={isCancelling}
    variant="outline"
    size="sm"
    className="border-gray-300 text-gray-700 hover:bg-gray-50"
  >
    <X className="w-3 h-3 mr-1" />
    {isCancelling ? "Cancelling..." : "Cancel"}
  </Button>
)}
```

**Conditions Enforced:**
- `!airdrop.resolved` - Not already completed
- `!airdrop.cancelled` - Not already cancelled
- `airdrop.qualifiersCount === 0` - No approved entries yet

**Note:** The `ManageSection.tsx` component already had proper conditions (line 316):
```typescript
disabled={
  selectedAirdropForManage.qualifiersCount > 0 ||
  selectedAirdropForManage.resolved ||
  selectedAirdropForManage.cancelled
}
```

With helpful user feedback showing why cancel isn't available.

## User Flow

### When Creator CAN Cancel:
- Airdrop is active (not resolved, not cancelled)
- **No entries have been approved yet** (qualifiersCount = 0)
- Cancel button appears
- Creator gets full refund of escrowed ETH

### When Creator CANNOT Cancel:
- **At least one entry has been approved** (qualifiersCount > 0)
- Airdrop is resolved or cancelled
- Cancel button is hidden
- Creator must wait until deadline and finalize the airdrop:
  1. Choose eligible participants
  2. Distribute ETH to approved entries
  3. Get refund of any leftover ETH

### Why This Design?
Once the creator approves entries, participants expect to receive their rewards. Allowing cancellation would:
- ❌ Break trust with participants who completed tasks
- ❌ Allow creators to rug pull after seeing submissions
- ❌ Create unfair situations where work is done but not paid

The contract enforces this at the blockchain level, and now the UI properly reflects these rules.
