All features include ZK verification integration via the ZKVerification contract.

---

## 1. Looking for Grant (LFG)

**Contract:** `LookingForGrant.sol` (0x423fb3E158B8bA79Fabbd387dAEb844DC0709BeF)

---

## 2. Grant Programs (Offering a Grant)

**Contract:** `GrantProgram.sol` (0xf70fBEba52Cc2A6F1e511179A10BdB4B820c7879)

## 3. Crowdfunding

**Contract:** `Crowdfunding.sol` (0x64aC0a7A52f3E0a414D8344f6A4620b51dFfB6C2)
**Component:** `src/components/CrowdfundingManager.tsx`

### Features Implemented:

### User Flow:
1. Creator verifies identity via ZK
2. Creates campaign with milestones (e.g., "Research: 1 ETH", "Development: 2 ETH")
3. Public contributes toward goal
4. If goal reached before deadline → "Successful"
5. If goal NOT reached → "Failed" (contributors claim refunds)
6. If successful, creator releases milestones sequentially
7. Creator withdraws released milestone funds
8. Auto-marked as "Completed" when all milestones withdrawn

### Campaign Status Flow:
- **Active** → Accepting contributions
- **Successful** → Goal reached, milestone release begins
- **Failed** → Deadline passed, goal not reached (refunds available)
- **Completed** → All milestones withdrawn

### Milestone Status:
- **Pending** → Not yet released
- **Released** → Creator approved (funds available for withdrawal)
- **Withdrawn** → Creator withdrew funds

---

## ZK Verification Integration

All 3 funding types require ZK verification for creators/grantors:

**Contract:** `ZKVerification.sol` (0xe3cd834a963B3A6A550aed05ece2535B02C83E3a)

### Current Implementation:
- Users must verify their identity before creating:
  - Looking for Grant requests
  - Grant programs
  - Crowdfunding campaigns
- Verification checks social handles (Twitter/X, GitHub, etc.)
- Currently uses placeholder ZK proof verification
- UI shows verification status with alerts

### UI Verification Flow:
1. User connects wallet
2. Component checks `ZKVerification.getVerification(address)`
3. If not verified → Shows warning alert
4. If verified → Shows success alert + enables "Create" actions

**Note:** The smart contract has placeholder ZK verification that accepts any proof. Real ZK proof verification (e.g., Reclaim Protocol) needs to be integrated in the future.

## Funding Page UI

**Route:** `/funding`
**File:** `src/app/funding/page.tsx`

### Design:
- **Header:** "Funding Platform" with description
- **3 Selection Cards:**
  - **Looking for Grant** (Blue, Rocket icon) - Flexible funding
  - **Offering a Grant** (Green, Gift icon) - Structured grants

## Data Flow Example

### Grant Program Flow:
```typescript

   → Escrows 10 ETH
   → Sets maxApplicants = 5
   → Status: Open

2. Projects apply: applyForGrant()
   → 15 applications received

3. VC approves 5 best: approveApplications([0,3,7,9,12], [2 ETH, 2 ETH, 2 ETH, 2 ETH, 2 ETH])
   → Status: SelectionPhase

4. VC finalizes: finalizeSelection()
   → Status: Active

5. Recipients claim: claimGrant()
   → Each receives their approved amount
   → Status: Completed (when all claimed)
```

### Crowdfunding Flow:
```typescript
1. Creator creates: createCampaign()
   → Goal: 5 ETH
   → Milestones: ["MVP: 2 ETH", "Beta: 2 ETH", "Launch: 1 ETH"]
   → Status: Active

2. Public contributes: contribute()
   → 30 people contribute
   → Total: 5.2 ETH reached

3. Auto-success: (contract auto-detects)
   → Status: Successful

4. Creator releases M1: releaseMilestone(0)
   → Milestone 0: Released

5. Creator withdraws M1: withdrawMilestone(0)
   → 2 ETH withdrawn
   → Milestone 0: Withdrawn

6. Repeat for M2 and M3
   → Status: Completed (when all withdrawn)
```
