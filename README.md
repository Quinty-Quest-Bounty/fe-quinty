# Quinty - Decentralized Work Protocol

> On-chain bounties, grants, and crowdfunding with soulbound reputation ‚Äî built on Base Sepolia.

---

## What is Quinty?

Quinty is a decentralized collaboration platform where:

- **Creators escrow 100% ETH** upfront (no underpayment risk)
- **Solvers deposit 10%** to prove commitment
- **Reputation is permanent** via soulbound NFT badges
- **Disputes are democratic** with stake-weighted community voting
- **All transactions are transparent** on Base

No platform fees. No middlemen. Just trustless collaboration.

**Address:** `0x7169c907F80f95b20232F5B979B1Aac392bD282a`

- **Winner Selection** ‚Äî Creators choose winners after deadline
- **Automatic Slashing** ‚Äî 25-50% goes to community voting if creator doesn't resolve
- **Team Support** ‚Äî Multi-member submissions with profit sharing

**How it works:**
```
Creator: Post task ‚Üí Escrow ETH ‚Üí Review submissions ‚Üí Select winners ‚Üí Funds distributed
