# Quinty Documentation

Welcome to the Quinty documentation space. These pages are formatted so GitBook can import and render them directly.

- Use this landing page for high-level product and architecture overviews.
- Navigate with the sidebar generated from `SUMMARY.md`.
- Cross-project design notes and audits remain in the repository root for now; link to them as needed.

## Next Steps
- Add additional Markdown files inside the `docs/` folder to grow the manual.
- Update `SUMMARY.md` whenever you want to expose new pages in the GitBook sidebar.
- Connect this repository to a GitBook space and point it at this folder to sync the content automatically.
