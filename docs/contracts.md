# Contract ABIs

The Quinty frontend relies on the ABI bundle stored at `contracts/all-abis.json`. For a detailed description of the contract responsibilities, refer to `../contracts/README.md`.

When you add or modify smart contracts, regenerate the ABI bundle and refresh both documents so GitBook and the frontend stay in sync.
